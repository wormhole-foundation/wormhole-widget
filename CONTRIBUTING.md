## Contributing

- Instead of opening opening pull requests to add tokens directly into Wormhole Connect, please use the configuration to add them into your own deployment.
- We welcome typo and grammar fixes to *public facing* documents. This includes things like the whitepapers, but excludes inline code comments. PRs that touch only the latter will be rejected. Fixing typos in comments alongside other non-trivial engineering work is welcome.
- Pull requests that modify dependencies must be well-documented so that the benefits of updating can be weighed against security and compatibility concerns. Low-effort PRs that update dependencies without any documentation will be rejected.
- Feature additions must be discussed ahead of time before a pull request is created.

### Setup

Development happens inside the `wormhole-connect` directory at the top level of the repo.

```
cd wormhole-connect
```

1) Install dependencies

```
npm i
```

2) Start demo app with Vite

```
npm run start
```

This should start a local server at localhost:5173.

### Pre-commit hooks

Set up your pre-commit hook:

```bash
echo "./pre-commit.sh" > .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x ./pre-commit.sh
```

## Maintaining OFAC sanctioned wallet list

From time to time, the CI may fail with the following error:

```
New addresses found, please update `SANCTIONED_WALLETS` in `src/consts/wallet.ts`.
```

This means that the list of sanctioned wallets has changed. To update the list, run the following command, which grabs the updated list of addresses:

```sh
$ ts-node wormhole-connect/scripts/ofac/getSdnList.ts
```

Copy the outputted list and paste it into `src/consts/wallet.ts` as the value of `SANCTIONED_WALLETS`.
